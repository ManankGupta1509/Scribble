                <h2>That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime</h2>
                <p> The darkness envelopes all, preventing me from seeing any shape or figure.
                    Where am I? Besides, what had happened?
                    Wasn’t there someone making fun of me, calling me a… sage?… no, a great sage.
                    
                    With that thought, I regained consciousness.
                    My name is Mikami Satoru. A 37 year old, nice guy.
                    While saving my kouhai[1] from a some street slasher, I got stabbed instead.
                    Alright~, remembered. I’m okay. No time for panic.
                    And really, could a cool guy like me even panic? Hah. That’s as likely as a grade school kid shi**ing his pants.
                    When I tried to look around, I finally noticed. I can’t open my eyes.
                    That problem aside, when I attempted to touch my head… I noticed my arms don’t respond. And even more perplexing is the fact that I cannot tell where my head is.
                    Alright, time to panic.
                    Oi, oi, give me a sec here.
                    Just an hour please, let me catch my breath. They say that you should count prime numbers at a time like this, no?
                    1, 2, 3, Daaaaa!!!
                    Wrong! That’s not right. One is not a prime number, is it?
                    No no, who cares about that.
                    No time for this foolishness. I mean, aren’t I in trouble?
                    Are~? Hey, what the heck happened?
                    Maybe… I mean what if it is too late to even consider panicking?
                    Gathering my thoughts, I confirmed that I am in no way in pain.
                    No pain. Feeling pretty good.
                    Neither hot nor cold. Actually, a really comfortable atmosphere they’ve got here.
                    I can relax a bit thanks to that.
                    Next, let’s check the limbs. Forget about them fingertips, I can’t even move a muscle…
                    How could that be?
                    It’s not like one can lose their arms and legs from being stabbed… so what happened?
                    And still, I cannot open my eyes.
                    Without seeing anything, I am in utter darkness.
                    Dread and unease slowly creep their way into my heart.
                    Could this… be what they call a vegetative state?
                    Consciousness separated from nerve endings–immobile… is this what it is?
                    No, no, no, no! Please don’t let that be true!
                    Just when I thought I was saved… vegetative state? What could be worse? Even losing a half of my body would be preferable!
                    And yeah, both outcomes would be terrible. But to be alone in this darkness, without any senses… isn’t that just hell?
                    Having imagined the worst scenario, panic has quickly turned into despair.
                    I want to think it over.
                    They say that when people are confined in darkness, they quickly go mad. I happen to be in that state right now, and cannot even kill myself.
                    Rather than despairing, the only thing I can do is go insane, huh?
                    And then,</p>

                <h2>What is linting and how can it save you time?</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges in software development is time. It’s something we can’t easily get more of, but linting can help us make the most out of the time we have.</p>

                <h2>How to Get More Views on Your Tech Blog</h2>
                <p>If you're a developer with a Twitter account, you've already seen everyone and their cat start a blog, YouTube channel, or Patreon. We all want to become stars, or at the very least, a recognizable name in the industry.</p>

                <h2>How to write easily describable code</h2>
                <p>When code is not describable using words, most people have to do some mental mapping to turn it in to words. This wastes mental energy, and you run the risk of getting the mapping wrong. Different people will map to different words, which
                    leads to confusion when discussing the code.</p>

                <h2>Everything you should know about ‘module’ & ‘require’ in Node.js</h2>
                <p>Node.js treats each JavaScript file as a separate module. For instance, if you have a file containing some code and this file is named xyz.js, then this file is treated as a module in Node, and you can say that you’ve created a module
                    named xyz.</p>
